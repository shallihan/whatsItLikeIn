# Use of a Third Party API

A very basic site that generates the current weather forecast in a city of the users choice. 


## If you want to see this code in action

You will have to register for a OpenWeather API Key. Follow the instructions at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/guide/#how). 

OpenWeather will give you an API Key, which youâ€™ll need to save in main.js.
